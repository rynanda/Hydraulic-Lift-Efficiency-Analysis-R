# Hydraulic Lift Efficiency Analysis with R
Assessing the effects of various factors on hydraulic lift efficiency through experiments and using R. Investigating the amount of force (N) required to operate a compression tube in order to lift a mass to a height of 5cm from its resting position and determine how each of 4 variables can be modified to affect the mechanical advantage when operating the lift. Includes ANOVA, ANCOVA, Tukey's HSD, assumption testing, linear regression models, and more coded using R.
